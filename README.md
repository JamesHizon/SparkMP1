# Spark Mini-Project 1

### Description
This repository contains three files:
1. ```Final_Autoinc_Spark.py``` - Python script.
2. ```final_output.txt``` - Text file of final output.
3. ```spark_mp_data.csv``` - CSV File with data needed for Spark

I basically needed to use Spark vs. Hadoop to complete the tasks from prior mini-project.
Here, we can see that Spark requires less steps and complexity.

In order to successfully run this Mini-Project, I needed to ensure that the Spark jar files was in the right directory.
In addition, make sure that ```pyspark``` is installed to use with IDE.

### How to run:
```
spark-submit Final_Autoinc_Spark.py
```
